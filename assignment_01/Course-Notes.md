## Important terms
ipynb
: interactive python notebook 

pwd
 : present working directory
 
ls
 : list files

## Code writing ediquitte
- Every Github repository should have a README.md
- Include a title, author, and date in markdown file

## How to's
### Github
To add a new folder to Github use a forward slash when adding a new file 

### Deepnote
 - To add an interactive python notebook to Github, download the notebook to your local machine, then upload on Github profile 
 - Notebooks can run from the same page on which they are edited, while .py files must run from the terminal (a feature in deepnote) 
 
 ## Code Writing Basics 
 
# Notes from Text Book Chapters 1 & 2

## Essential Python Libraries

**NumPy**
 - Cornerstone of Numerical comupting in Python
 - Provides the data structures, algorithms, and library glue for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python
 - NumPy arrays are more effeciant than Python data structures for storing and manipulating data

**Pandas**
 - For working with tabular data
 - DataFrame = tabular, column-oriented data structure with rows and column labels
 - Series = one-dimensional labeled array object
 - Best for data manipulation, preparation, and cleaning

**matplotlib**
 - To create plots suitable for publication 
 
##IPython Basics
**Tab**
 - While entereing expressions in the shell, press the Tab key to search for the namespace for any variables matching the characters you have typed so far
 
**Introspection**
 - Using a question mark (?) before or after a variable will display general inormation about the object
 
**The %run Command**
 - Run any file as a Python program by ussing the %run command
 
**Interrupting running code 
 - Pressing Ctrl-C while code is running will cause a KeyboardInterrupt to be raised 

## Python Language Basics 
**Indentation**
 - Python uses whitespace to structure code
 - Always use 4 spaces, as is standard 

**Comments**
 - text preceded by # is ignored by Python interpreter
 - Hashtag is normally used to comment 
 - Comments can go on the same line of code (behind it), or on the line preceding the code 
 
**Argument Passing**
 - When assigning a variable in Python, you are creating a reference, see Practice-01.ipynb for example
 
**Dynamic reference, strong types**
 - Python is considered a strongly typed language, which means that every object has a specific type (or class), and implicit conversions will occur only in certain obvious circumstances
